  DUE Saturday, August 17 at 11:59pm (Week 15)

  Maximum of 5 minutes

##GRADE

  35% RMarkdown File
  35% Final Video Presentation (25% slide content, 25% presentation)
    Minimal Stumbles / mis statements / etc.  if you trip up more than a couple of times, reshoot the video.
    Labeled Plots
    5-minute time limit
    Correct interpretation
    Complete analysis – this means adding pvalues and conducting tests where appropriate (I expect
  everyone to have a good handle on at least t-tests, KNN and Naïve Bayes classification and KNN and linear regression to this point.
  10% Validation Requirement for Attrition(Sensitivity and Specificity > 60%)
  10% Validation Requirement for Salary(RMSE < $3000)
  10% Creativity and completeness in presentation and analysis.

##AUDIENCE

  your audience is the CEO and CFO of Frito Lay (your client)

  CEO is a statistician and the CFO has had only one class in statistics

##GOAL
  Identify factors that contribute to turnover
    -Create derived attributes/variables/features

  Job Role specific trends (e.g., “Data Scientists have the highest job satisfaction”)
    - Interesting trends or observations

  Experimentation and visualization

  Include labeled data from competition set


##MODELING

  Classifying attrition you must use k-NN or Naive Bayes but can also use logisitc regresion, random forest, LDA, SVM)

  Regression as well, linear regression, LASSO, random forest, enseble models

##DATA

  Competition set (300 observations no labels)
